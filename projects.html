    	    	<p>This project is for the minetest community, it is intended to serve as a content database where users can easily find modifications, servers, skins, and other content. It is helping me build my skills in Python and Django as well as SQL and general web server management. My goal is to have it enter a live beta during the first half of 2018.</p>

    	    <div class="information">
    	    	<p>This project is a resturant management system designed specifically for McDonalds but with the intention to be universal and capable of being used by any resturant from fast food to dining. The goal of the project is to reduce the cost of installing smart technology in a resturant while creating a faster and more capable system. This project is primarily helping me build my skills in Java and various Java librarys although I plan on integrating Python in the future. I am working on this as a school project or as I get the free time.</p>
