      <h1>Bootstrap ready</h1>
      <p>I have taken the time to study and become compitent with the latest version of bootstrap. Boot strap is a framework that allows for faster creation of better websites. The framework provides well tested code to create responsive websites that look great on every device so I can spend more time on building your website without worrying about developing the back end code.</p>

          <h2>Grid Layout</h2>
          <p>Boot strap comes loaded with a well built grid system to allow me to create content that looks great on any device. The grid layout creates these boxes of content that rearrange themselves when on a larger or smaller device.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Responsive</h2>
          <p>Responsive is a key word in web development. It means that the website responds to its environment so content is always easy to access and looks great. Bootstrap is built off the idea of being responsive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Try it out!</h2>
          <p>To see what all this responsive stuff is about try it yourself! Load this website on a computer and on a phone to see how the same page adjusts itself so it looks great. You can also change the size of your window on a computer to see it in action.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Rapid development</h2>
          <p>I mentioned above that development is faster, that is because a lot of the repetitive work is done for me. Building a responsive framework from scratch takes time. With bootstrap I dont need to do this and can spend more time making sure the content itself is top quality.</p>
